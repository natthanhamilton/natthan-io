The company has been running manually processes across the board, and through recent growth they have been experiencing, decided to seek a solution to their growing pains. After evaluating their business and their perceived endless problems, the project focused on attacking their problems at the beginning of their business cycle. They traditionally receive orders from customers via email or phone, which then begins a long email process. By developing a custom wholesale commerce application that integrated into, and rebuilt in a lot of cases, their existing business, Prints Charming experienced even greater growth now with an automated application that their customers can order for themselves, allowing for employee time to be spent more strategically. Existing retailers were ordering multiple times more product than they normally would due to a visually driven buying experience where they were exposed to products they did not know existed. The byproduct of choosing this area to attack was the direct need to structure their business and data appropriately so that it was even possible to have an automated system. Streamlining their business in such a way is allowing for tremendous growth at a fraction of the cost previously needed in manual labor",
