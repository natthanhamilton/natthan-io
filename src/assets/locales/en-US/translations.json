		"title": "My Story",
		"content": "Being around technology my whole life as a second generation engineer, I first engaged code at ten years old, creating PHP and MySQL applications. At ten, I wanted to build game communities for the groups of friends I was always playing online video games with (shout out to Counter-Strike!).\n\n Homeschooling through high school not by choice, I chose to end that torture as quickly as possible by graduating high school at fifteen and a half, and get onto junior college. After spending my teenage years deep in technology, I started to shy away from it as I was progressing into my young college life eager to fit into groups and be more cool. Being able to teach myself, I chose to study the inner workings of business and subsequently spend my first years out of college in sales roles to gain a deep understanding of how a business operates. I can attribute the insight to take such a direction to the teachings of my father -- Technology serves the business, or there is no business for the technologist to thrive in!\n\n Bringing it full circle, I am now fortunate to have well crafted skills on both sides of the spectrum and have tested it in various fashions. Now, after having proven that I can craft something from nothing, my interest is now understanding at a deep level the meaning of \"massive scale\""
