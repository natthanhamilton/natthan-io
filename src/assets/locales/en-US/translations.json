    "content":
      "Being around technology my whole life as a second generation engineer, I first engaged code at ten years old, creating PHP and MySQL applications. At ten, I wanted to build game communities for the groups of friends I was always playing online video games with (shout out to Counter-Strike!).\n\n Homeschooling through high school not by choice, I chose to end that torture as quickly as possible by graduating high school at fifteen and a half, and get onto junior college. After spending my teenage years deep in technology, I started to shy away from it as I was progressing into my young college life eager to fit into groups and be more cool. Being able to teach myself, I chose to study the inner workings of business and subsequently spend my first years out of college in sales roles to gain a deep understanding of how a business operates. I can attribute the insight to take such a direction to the teachings of my father -- Technology serves the business, or there is no business for the technologist to thrive in!\n\n Bringing it full circle, I am now fortunate to have well crafted skills on both sides of the spectrum and have tested it in various fashions. Now, after having proven that I can craft something from nothing, my interest is now understanding at a deep level the meaning of \"massive scale\""

Veteran staff told me stories of how every year prior was wraught with around the clock shifts, product backed up for weeks, thousands of backlogged images to process, and so forth. \n\nThe collage builder eliminated such an extreme amount of labor from the top down:\n -- designers had no work to do and were thus going into production to add extra support, allowing for backlogs to dwindle to nothing, which allowed staff to rest and perform at their best\n -- Morale was up\n -- No 24 shifts happened the whole season\n -- All deadlines were hit and product shipped\n -- Less mistakes happened during production, causing less returned product\n\n By fixing the biggest pain point in their product's production cycle, it managed to directly impact all parts of their business.\n The collage builder would go on to product tens of thousands of prints by itself without any designer involvement.

          "Prints Charming is a built from the ground up custom solution for a wholesale company that has been in business for decades. The company has been running manually processes across the board, and through recent growth they have been experiencing, decided to seek a solution to their growing pains. After evaluating their business and their perceived endless problems, the project focused on attacking their problems at the beginning of their business cycle. They traditionally receive orders from customers via email or phone, which then begins a long email process. By developing a custom wholesale commerce application that integrated into, and rebuilt in a lot of cases, their existing business, Prints Charming experienced even greater growth now with an automated application that their customers can order for themselves, allowing for employee time to be spent more strategically. Existing retailers were ordering multiple times more product than they normally would due to a visually driven buying experience where they were exposed to products they did not know existed. The byproduct of choosing this area to attack was the direct need to structure their business and data appropriately so that it was even possible to have an automated system. Streamlining their business in such a way is allowing for tremendous growth at a fraction of the cost previously needed in manual labor",
